# 2FA Authentication System

## Overview

This project implements a secure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system designed to enhance application security by requiring users to verify their identity through two different authentication methods. By combining something the user knows (password) with something the user has (mobile device), 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Secure account creation with email verification
- **First Factor Authentication**: Password-based authentication with strong hashing
- **Second Factor Authentication**: 
  - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) implementation
  - QR code generation for easy mobile app configuration
  - SMS verification option for users without authenticator apps
- **Account Recovery**: Secure process for users who lose access to their second factor
- **Session Management**: Secure handling of authenticated sessions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of authentication attempts

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: [Your backend technology stack]
- **Security**: 
  - TOTP implementation using RFC 6238 standards
  - Secure storage of authentication secrets
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- **Integrations**:
  - Compatible with standard authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
  - SMS gateway integration for text message verification

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [List prerequisites here]

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2fa-authentication.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run the application
npm start
```

## Usage Guide

### Administrator Setup

1. Configure the authentication parameters in the admin panel
2. Set up SMS gateway credentials if using SMS verification
3. Customize email templates for account verification

### User Enrollment

1. User creates an account and verifies email
2. During first login, user is prompted to set up 2FA
3. User scans QR code with google authenticator app
4. User enters the generated code to complete setup

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters username and password (first factor)
2. System prompts for the second factor authentication code
3. User enters the code from google authenticator app
4. Upon successful verification, user is granted access

## Security Considerations

- **Secret Storage**: 2FA secrets are encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption
- **Backup Codes**: System provides one-time use backup codes for recovery
- **Session Security**: Sessions are invalidated after security-sensitive changes
- **Brute Force Prevention**: Implemented with progressive delays and account lockouts
